## `r fa("diagram-project")` TECHNICAL EXPERIENCES (4)

### `r fa("guitar")` Data Visualization for Jazz Musicians (Thesis)

-   Adviser: Prof. Chen-Hai Andy Tsao
-   Date: 06/2021 - 06/2023
-   Location: National Dong-Hwa University
-   Links: [PDF](https://yihsinlu.github.io/yhlu.io/PDF/Visualization4JazzMusicians.pdf), [Maps for Jazz Musicians](https://yihsinlu.github.io/Jazz.io/JazzMusicianMaps/JazzMusicianMaps.html)
-   Summary
    -   Displayed the visualization as a map.
    -   Utilized three primary colors on multi-value variables.
    -   Illustrate the relationship between musicians by their distance and color based on variables, such as instruments, genres, etc.
    -   Utilized PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to generate the map from the data matrix.
    -   The map provides richer insights compared to network graphs, exemplified by the acclaimed visualization at Linked Jazz.

### `r fa("volleyball")` Volleyball Matches/Players Visualization (Interest-Driven Project)

-   Date: 10/2023 - Present
-   Links: [Maps Webpage](https://yihsinlu.github.io/yhlu.io/TVL/matches_options.html)
-   Summary
    -   Developed a map visualization for displaying player data during volleyball matches.
    -   Implemented histograms and tables to effectively illustrate match information between teams.
    -   The map highlights relationships and statistics among players in different positions.
    -   Streamlined information accessibility, saving players valuable time by eliminating the need to navigate through extensive data tables.

### `r fa("file-audio")` Music Feature (Statistical Machine Learning)

-   Adviser: Prof. Chen-Hai Andy Tsao

-   Location: National Dong-Hwa University
-   Links: [PDF](https://yihsinlu.github.io/yhlu.io/PDF/StatisticalMachineLearningClassProject_FinalReport.pdf)
-   Summary
    -   Applied statistical machine learning techniques to filter audio genres based on their features.
    -   Achieved a 70% accuracy using the random forest model.

### `r fa("database")` S&P Global Rating Xpress Dataset (Dataset Management)

-   PI: Prof. Chih-Kang Chu
-   Date: 08/2022 - 01/2023
-   Location: National Dong-Hwa University
-   Summary
    -   Utilized PostgreSQL to create a connection with the online database, facilitating data updates in local storage.
    -   Developed a data transformation function using R, ensuring data accuracy and cleanliness.
